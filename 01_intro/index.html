    <h3>Final Project Proposal: Shoe Rack Elevator</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Aaron Kang,  PS70 2023</p>

  <hr>

  <p>My first idea for a final project was an automated garage shoe rack of sorts for the tons of shoes that we have in our dorm between myself and my roommate.</p>

  <p>In any given Asian household, there is a pile of shoes by the door, and my roommate and I are no exception. Between our running shoes, boots, slippers, and everyday walking shoes, our measly salvaged shoe rack can't hold them all. Furthermore, it's difficult among the pile of shoes to find the shoe that you want quickly. Being on the ground also causes us to have to bend down to store the shoes and to access them -- a smaller problem, but one that I will attempt to address with my project.</p>

<!-- I'm pretty sure this is to add images so I'll put in images of our messy shoe rack later.  -->

  <p>I want to build my new shoe rack elevator based on the design of car elevators used in places like New York City where space is limited for parking. With these car carosels, the cars are stacked vertically and move on a vertical chain of sorts to bring any given car down to the ground level to be retrieved by the driver. Instead of cars leaving out the bottom, my machine would be transporting shoes up to the top so that I can reach them.</p>
