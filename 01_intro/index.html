    <h3>Final Project Proposal</h3>
  </div>

  <p>I am not PK I am Aaron</p>

  <hr>

  <p>My first idea for a final project was an automated garage shoe rack of sorts for the tons of shoes that we have in our dorm between myself and my roommate.</p>

  <p>Iterating on the rovers gives me an interesting provocation, a strong starting point including CAD files that I worked on, and already definitely involves 3D design, electronics, and microcontroller usage. However, there's some complexity because the team I worked with, who is back in California, is also already deep in the process of making the next generation. I don't want to duplicate effort with them, and working with them would be difficult to align with PS70's final project timeline.</p>

  <p><i>Gen 1 CAD, a Gen 1 bot, and early Gen 2 CAD</i></p>

  <p>A possible solution would be to take the rover in a different direction than the team, while still basing my next iteration on the first version. That way, I get the benefits of a strong foundation without the complexities.</p>

  <p>The fidget tower is an idea for a desk fidget and lamp combined. It has multiple "floors" or stages that each rotate independently with tactile feedback (like a ratchet on one, or a really smooth bearing on another) to be a good fidget, and depending on the orientation of the stages relative to each other, they will light up.</p>

  <p>The fidget tower would see actual use by me, whereas I'm not sure whether the rover has much actual application now that the camp experience is over and I'm not working with the main team.</p>
