  	<h3>About Me</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Hi! I'm PK or Lauren - I use both names interchangeably. My pronouns are they/them. I'm class of 2025, concentrating in Computer Science on the Mind, Brain, Behavior track, and live in Winthrop House.</p>

  <p>I'm currently developing <i>We Are Free Mice</i>, an interactive fiction game, with Zero Summer Studios. Learn more about that <a href="https://www.wearefreemice.com/">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Most of my past work has been with <a href="www.tinkeringschool.com">Tinkering School</a>, where I've taught and supported eight to sixteen year old tinkerers in making enormous structures and moving mechanisms of their own design. One of my favorite projects was this three-story wooden rocket ship:</p>

  <p>I'm also part of the Tinkering School: Mars Missions team. Over the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed a fully virtual collaborative experience for people on Earth to drive rovers "on Mars."</p>

  <p>In my free time, I like to bake macarons, play d&d, and read.</p>
