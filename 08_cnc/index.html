    <h3>CNC & Molding and Casting</h3>
  </div>

  <p><i>1. Design something and make it using CNC. You may use the ShopBot (2D outlines), the Shaper (2D outlines) or the SRM-20 (2.5D molds).</i></p>
  <p><i>2. Create something by molding and casting.</i></p>

        <p>This week, I wanted to use the CNC machine to cut out a jewelry dish in the shape of the Hawaiian plumeria (which Cassia later called "the spongebob flower looking thing"). To do this, I designed a simple 2d sketch of the flower and the sketch of the inside. I overlayed a simple image of the flower for reference on the plane. </p>

        <p>Once that was complete, I brought the dxf file into the shopbot software. I wasn't able to get photos of this process, but I'll try to briefly describe the process. The work piece is secured to a sacrificial layer of wood on the shopbot and is held down by plastic nails. I did an "air cut" to see if the tool path was correct, and then adjusted the CNC machine to the piece of work. To make the dish shape, I set the inside outline to the "pocket" setting, cutting only through the first couple layers of wood. </p>

  <p><i>The CNC machine cuts layer by layer (sort of like a backwards 3D printer).</i></p>

<p> After cutting out the piece, it was quite rough, so I took it to the belt sander to smooth out some of the edges that the CNC was not able to do well. Overall I was very happy with the result due to the simple design. I then put the cut piece into the vacuum former to create a mold. </p>

<p><i>I messed up the first couple of times using the vacuum former -- turns out turning on the vacuum while waiting for the sheet to heat up was not helpful :/</i></p>

<p> Finally, after the vacuum mold was ready, I poured plaster decorate with a bit of purple dye into the negative vacuum mold to recreate the positive model of the flower dish.</p>

<p> Here's the final result! Works very well to hold my rings and earrings. </p>
